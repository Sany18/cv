      <p>
        I`m experienced Web Developer for more then {getExperienceYears()} years. I have knowledge in developing, testing, debugging, optimization,
        deployment and support of web applications. My journey started as full-stack developer but for the last {getExperienceYears() - 3} years I have
        preferred only front-end development.
